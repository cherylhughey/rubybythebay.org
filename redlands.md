### Venue information

{{ site.data.constants.dates.year}} Ruby by the Bay will be held {{ site.data.constants.dates.start}} - {{ site.data.constants.dates.end}} ({{ site.data.constants.dates.start_day}} - {{ site.data.constants.dates.end_day}}) at the University of Redlands, home of San Francisco Theological Seminary, in San Anselmo, California.

###### More about the venue
Our venue is located in Marin county, about an hour north of San Francisco.  We'll be staying in a two-story building surrounded by redwood trees, with a kitchen, dining hall, and living room in-building.  We'll also be using a nearby conference facility for more team space.

###### What will sleeping arrangements be like?

Rooms are double-occupancy (2 twin beds).  A set of clean sheets and towels will be provided by the venue on check-in.  Showers and restrooms are available on each floor.  As we will be the sole occupants of the building, we will be able to accommodate bathroom needs for all genders.

###### What should I expect around food?

We will be sharing the work of cooking and cleaning up after meals, with each team taking responsibility for a different meal.  Please contact us for dietary restrictions.

###### How do I get there? What do you recommend for transportation?

There is ample parking but we strongly recommend you carpool. We usually help attendees self-organize rides in our Slack.

For those coming by plane, your two closest airports are SFO and OAK. {{ site.data.constants.venue_name }} is about an hour away from either airport.

For those coming by plane from the east coast, note that timezones are in your favor! We won't be starting the event until 4pm on {{site.data.constants.dates.start_day}}. If you take a 6am flight out of BWI, you could be in OAK by 9am and have the entire day to explore SF, cycle or hike in the area surrounding the venue, take a surfing lesson at Bolinas Beach, or even give yourself a tour of the local cheese makers! We strongly recommend coordinating and asking for advice on Slack as the time gets closer.

(Reminder: Southwest Airlines does not show up on most flight searches, and they give two free bags - great for if you want to pack that down comforter!)

###### What should I bring?

- Laptop + power supply
- Clothes + toiletries
- Games

Historically weather has been between 40-70Â°F, so please bring clothes appropriate for the weather. Layers are great.

###### I have more questions!

Please ask away! We'd love to update this page with any missing information.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](/coc.html) prior to attending.
